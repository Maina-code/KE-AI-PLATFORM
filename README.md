Nuru AI – National Intelligence Early Warning & Audit Intelligence Platform

Nuru AI is a secure, AI-powered intelligence system designed to help investigative agencies detect risks, verify documents, and uncover irregular financial patterns with speed and accuracy. The platform serves national bodies such as the EACC, Auditor-General, procurement units, and other government audit institutions that require fast, reliable, and traceable insights.

Nuru AI blends machine learning, document intelligence, anomaly detection, and structured workflows into one centralized system built for national-level investigations.

Mission

To provide a trusted, AI-driven intelligence platform that strengthens government audit processes, supports anti-corruption efforts, and enhances early detection of suspicious activities across Kenya.

The Problem

Investigative agencies handle millions of documents, transactions, and procurement records. Manual verification is slow, prone to human error, and creates opportunities for fraud to go undetected.

Agencies need:

Real-time insights

Automated document verification

Risk scoring

Secure audit trails

Fast reporting

Scalable intelligence tools

Nuru AI solves these challenges by automating the investigative workflow end-to-end.
